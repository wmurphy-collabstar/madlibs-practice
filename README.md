# MadLibs

> A Javascript exercise that dynamically adds text for different words as is done in MadLibs. For my project, I picked a pirate story template, then made some words placeholders and added styling to make those editable words contrast from the rest of the story.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
3. In your file navigator application, navigate to the folder with the git repo inside
5. Open the `index.html` file and preview the site in your browser
6. *Optional*: To change the values of the words, open the `MadLibs.js` file in your code editor and change the values of the variables at the top of the file
> **Note**: If you edit the variable values, **make sure to keep the variable names, types and structures the same. Otherwise, the code will not compile**.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* LTS version of Node installed
* A terminal
* A code editor if you plan on inspecting, editing, or contributing to the code.

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wmurphy-collabstar/madlibs-practice.git
$ cd madlibs-practice
$ code .
```
> **Note**: The last command works if you have it configured to open up your editor from the terminal (as you can with Visual Studio Code)

### Branches

* Main: The branch with the latest stable version of the application
